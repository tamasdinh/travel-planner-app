## Project goals

The goal of the project was to build a webapp from scratch that utilizes external APIs to serve information to users on their planned trips. Key functionalities built:
- ```dynamically generated location search results``` (via the GeoNames API)
- ```custom hero shot and photogrid``` with photos of the chosen location (via the PixaBay API)
- ```weather information``` for chosen start date and duration of trip (via the DarkSky API)
- ```user choices are persisted``` throughout reloads by storing relevant trip data in localStorage

The app was built from scratch with ```Webpack``` as the build tool and ```Express.js``` as the API router. On the landing screen the user can select start dates and duration from drop-down menus as well as location from a text input field that serves recommended search results in a drop-down. Photo and weather data are served with one-click after location and date selections. The user has a dedicated button to reset trip data and another one to clear photo and weather results.

## Getting Started

You can clone the project files by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamasdinh/travel-planner-app.git
```

in your command line. This will download the entire repository to your computer, into a subfolder named ```travel-planner app``` in the folder from which you initiated cloning. Alternatively, you can download the repo as a ```zip``` file from the repo page.

Once you have the repo on your local machine, first you have to install dependencies by ```cd```-ing into the project folder and running:
```bash
npm install
```

Once you have dependencies installed, you have 4 options:

1. Run ```npm start``` and then run ```npm run dev```:
    - the first command starts the local API bridge server and the second starts ```webpack-dev-server```. You can try out the app in development mode this way.

2. Run ```npm run prod```
    - this build the production bundle and starts the local server, which in this case not only serves the API bridge but also serves the landing page. You can try out the app in production mode this way.

3. Run ```npm start``` and then run ```npm run test```
    - this start the local API bridge (needed for the tests to run) and then runs all tests defined.

4. Run ```npm run build```
    - this generates the production bundle into the ```/dist``` folder

```ENJOY!```

## Built With

* ```Javascript``` - Starting to grow on me :)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - The build tool used. Complicated, but very useful once you get the hang of it
* [Node.js and Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/) - for handling dependencies and project configuration
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - For those nasty transpilations between ES6 and browser-enabled Javascript
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) - API server framework used
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS supercharged. Makes responsive styling so much easier!
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io) - Simple testing framework; works with Webpack, Babel, React etc.
* [GeoNames API](https://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html) - a simple API to search for locations from various aspects
* [PixaBay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) - very useful API to the photos hosted on photo sharing site Pixabay.
* [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev) - flexible API to the weather data generated by Dark Sky. Can search for weather data 
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - Probably you already heard of it... ```AND``` it has incredibly useful developer tools built-in.
