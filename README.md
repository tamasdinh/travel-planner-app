## Project goals

The goal of the project was to build a webapp from scratch that utilizes external APIs to serve information to users on their planned trips. Key functionalities built:
- ```dynamically generated location search results``` (via the GeoNames API)
- ```custom hero shot and photogrid``` with photos of the chosen location (via the PixaBay API)
- ```weather information``` for chosen start date and duration of trip (via the DarkSky API)
- ```user choices are persisted``` throughout reloads by storing relevant trip data in localStorage

The app was built from scratch with ```Webpack``` as the build tool and ```Express.js``` as the API router. On the landing screen the user can select start dates and duration from drop-down menus as well as location from a text input field that serves recommended search results in a drop-down. Photo and weather data are served with one-click after location and date selections. The user has a dedicated button to reset trip data and another one to clear photo and weather results.

## Getting Started

You can clone the project files by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamasdinh/travel-planner-app.git
```

in your command line. This will download the entire repository to your computer, into a subfolder named ```travel-planner app``` in the folder from which you initiated cloning. Alternatively, you can download the repo as a ```zip``` file from the repo page.

Once you have the repo on your local machine, first you have to install dependencies by ```cd```-ing into the project folder and running:
```bash
npm install
```

Once you have dependencies installed, you should ```start the Express server``` by running
```bash
npm start
```
in the command line. The API server will start running on port 8081.

Once the Express server is running, you have two options:

__1.__ ```Start app in dev mode```

Start the Webpack dev server by running
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start ```webpack-dev-server```, build the project output in memory and serve the content by automatically opening it in your browser.

__2.__ ```Build project in production mode and open html```

Alternatively, you can ```build project files in production mode``` (provides additional optimizations as compared to the dev mode) by running
```bash
npm run build
```
and then opening ```index.html``` in the ```/dist``` subfolder.

__```Testing```__

You can also ```run relevant tests``` by running
```bash
npm run test
```

## Built With

* ```Javascript``` - Starting to grow on me :)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) - The build tool used. Complicated, but very useful once you get the hang of it
* [Node.js and Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/) - for handling dependencies and project configuration
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) - For those nasty transpilations between ES6 and browser-enabled Javascript
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) - API server framework used
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS supercharged. Makes responsive styling so much easier!
* [GeoNames API](https://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html) - a simple API to search for locations from various aspects
* [PixaBay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/) - very useful API to the photos hosted on photo sharing site Pixabay.
* [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev) - flexible API to the weather data generated by Dark Sky. Can search for weather data 
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) - Probably you already heard of it... ```AND``` it has incredibly useful developer tools built-in.
